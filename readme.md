# Bikrami Dates

The Bikrami calander, is a lunar based calendar used in the Punjab and Indic region.
It is used in the Dhan Dhan Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji as well.

It divides months based on emotions and happenings of that particular month.

###### Examples
**Chet** üå± when flowers and vegetation begin to sprout.

**Vaisakh** ü•ó when the most natural vegetation becomes ripe for harvest.

 **Har** üèú means the month of heat.

 **Sawan** is month of rain and also denotes to go to sleep a little more then.


## Prologue
I based this app around the knowledge that a new month happens 3 days after a
full moon. However note this calendar traditionally does not pay much heed to
the exact date rather people should just know which month it is

‚Äî As the moon effects the soul the "Bengali" peepz yo or la "Punjabi" people,
the ones in Punjab ye area of Gorkhnath and many saints including visits from God too
them found that during the full moon your sensory/**pranic**/empathic experiences are heightened
therfore there during those three days of full moon be reserved for breaktime from work, rather
 than the 5 day work week weekend fun some of us employ now instead.

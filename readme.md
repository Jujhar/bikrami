# Bikrami Dates

The Bikrami calander a lunar based calendar stems from Indic region and
is used in Nepal officailly as well as the Dhan Dhan Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji.

Dividing months based on emotions and happenings of each particular month.
For example:

**Chet** üå± when flowers and vegetation begin to sprout.

**Vaisakh** ü•ó when the most natural vegetation becomes ripe for harvest.

 **Har** üèú the month of the most heat.

 **Sawan** is month of rain also denotes to go to sleep a little more then.

I based this app around the knowledge that a new month happens 3 days after a
full moon. However note this calendar traditionally does not pay much heed to
the exact date rather people should just know which month it is

The full moon effects the soul and your sensory/**pranic**/empathic experiences are heightened then. The the "Bengali" peepz yo or la "Punjabi" people, the ones in Punjab (ye area of Gorkhnath and many saints including visits from God too) therfore during those three days of full moon reserved the days for breaktime from work, (rather than the 5 day work week weekend fun some of us employ now instead)
